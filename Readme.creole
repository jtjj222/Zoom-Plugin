==About
Zoom is a simple bukkit plugin that allows you to zoom in and out when you left/right (configurable) click with a configureable object in your hand. I got the idea from hawkfalkon's wonderful plugin [[http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/vertigo/|vertigo]].
comp500 added a Telescope item for it!

==What? Explain.
This is best explained in a few images (note: this shows the max zoom level. There are others in between):

==Ok, cool, why do my players need it?
Well, it is useful for you and your players to spy on each other, or shoot each other with arrows. It is a great addition to any pvp minecraft server.

==Support
I have been pretty busy lately, but if you have a problem, or find a bug, email me at jtjj222@live.ca, or pm me on the bukkit forums. My username is jtjj222. If there is a feature you really want though, why not implement it yourself and make a pull request? :D

==How to build
Just import the sources into your ide. In eclipse, place the source code into your workspace, then create a new project with the same name as the source code folder. Add bukkit (1.3+) to your build path, and everything should work!

==How to update the code
Make a pull request. No feature is too small, and no question is stupid :D
